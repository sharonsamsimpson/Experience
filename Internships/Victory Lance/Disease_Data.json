breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs what causes respiratory failure conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure these conditions may affect the muscles nerves bones or tissues that support breathing or they may affect the lungs directly these conditions include diseases that affect the lungs such as copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis pneumonia pulmonary embolism and covid19 conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als muscular dystrophy spinal cord injuries and stroke problems with the spine such as scoliosis a curve in the spine they can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs an injury to the chest can cause this damage drug or alcohol overdose inhalation injuries such as from inhaling smoke from fires or harmful fumes what are the symptoms of respiratory failure the symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood a low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger the feeling that you cant breathe in enough air your skin lips and fingernails may also have a bluish color a high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion some people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness they also may have arrhythmia irregular heartbeat you may have these symptoms if your brain and heart are not getting enough oxygen how is respiratory failure diagnosed your health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on your medical history a physical exam which often includes listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds listening to your heart to check for arrhythmia looking for a bluish color on your skin lips and fingernails diagnostic tests such as pulse oximetry a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood the sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear arterial blood gas test a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood the blood sample is taken from an artery usually in your wrist once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure your provider will look for what is causing it tests for this often include a chest xray if your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure you may have an ekg electrocardiogram this is simple painless test that detects and records your hearts electrical activity what are the treatments for respiratory failure treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether it is acute shortterm or chronic ongoing how severe it is what is causing it acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency you may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home but if your chronic respiratory failure is severe you might need treatment in a longterm care center one of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body another goal is to treat the cause of the condition treatments may include oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth tracheostomy a surgicallymade hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe a breathing tube also called a tracheostomy or trach tube is placed in the hole to help you breathe ventilator a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs it also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs other breathing treatments such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation nppv which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth to help you breathe in and out fluids often through an intravenous iv to improve blood flow throughout your body they also provide nutrition medicines for discomfort treatments for the cause of the respiratory failure these treatments may include medicines and procedures if you have respiratory failure see your health care provider for ongoing medical care your provider may suggest pulmonary

medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health it can make you feel tired hopeless worried or fearful it can change your thinking sleeping and eating depression may make some people think about ending their lives but antidepressants can help many people who have depression researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress are antidepressants used for other conditions a health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety chronic pain or insomnia sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions what are the different types of antidepressants there are many types of antidepressants each one works differently providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they dont cause as many side effects as older types they also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snris atypical antidepressants which are newer antidepressants that dont fit into the other groups if these antidepressants dont help your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants the older types include tricyclic antidepressants tcas tetracyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors maois even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people which type of antidepressant is right for me our bodies and brains all work differently that means one antidepressant wont work for everyone you may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you your provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first youll consider questions such as which symptoms bother you most some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms such as trouble sleeping what other medicines and supplements do you take some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative an antidepressant that helped a parent brother or sister could be a good choice for you too do you have other health conditions certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment are you pregnant planning for pregnancy or breastfeeding if so your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression thats safe for you and your baby how long do antidepressants take to work antidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work so youll need to be patient you may notice that some problems such as sleeping and eating get better before your mood improves thats a good sign you may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job sometimes an antidepressant helps at first but symptoms return while youre still taking it but theres usually another one you can try to get more relief from depression your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health how long will i need to take an antidepressant when an antidepressant starts to work you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it the typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer what are the side effects of antidepressants not everyone has side effects from antidepressants but if you do have them theyre usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine the most common side effects from antidepressants include nausea and vomiting weight gain diarrhea sleepiness sexual problems such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex when thinking about side effects its important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options if you have any side effects from antidepressants your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work if the side effects bother you too much you may need to change antidepressants but you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own if you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you such as new or worsening symptoms unusual changes in your mood or you start acting differently call your provider right away in some cases children teenagers and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed get medical help right away if this happens what can i do to take antidepressants safely antidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly tell your provider about everything you take that includes medicines herbs supplements and overthecounter medicines you take such as pain relievers and decongestants be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol too try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy that way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together follow all instructions about how to take your medicine talk with your provider if side effects bother you never stop taking antidepressants without your providers help stopping too fast may make depression come back you could even make your condition worse to stop antidepressants safely you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine your provider can tell you

a valve dont close tightly this allows the blood to leak backwards a common cause of regurgitation is prolapse where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back prolapse most often affects the mitral valve stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick stiff or stuck together this prevents the heart valve from opening all the way not enough blood can pass through the valve aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis it affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis what causes heart valve diseases some people are born with heart valve disease this is called congenital heart valve disease it can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases your chance of having heart valve disease is higher if you are older with age the heart valves can become thick and stiff you have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels these include rheumatic fever an untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever which can harm the heart valves the damage may not show up for years today most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage endocarditis this is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves it is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream a heart attack heart failure coronary artery disease especially when it affects the aorta the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body high blood pressure high blood cholesterol diabetes obesity and overweight lack of physical activity a family history of early heart disease a father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55 a mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65 you were born with an aortic valve that wasnt formed right sometimes this will cause problems right away other times the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems what are the symptoms of heart valve diseases many people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesnt work perfectly and never have any problems but heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time you may develop signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath feeling like you cant get enough air fatigue swelling in your feet ankles abdomen belly or the veins in your neck chest pain when youre physically active arrhythmia a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat dizziness or fainting if you dont get treatment for heart valve disease the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse what other problems can heart valve diseases cause when the valves dont work well your heart has to pump harder to get enough blood out to the body without treatment this extra workload on your heart can lead to heart failure stroke blood clots sudden cardiac arrest or death how is heart valve disease diagnosed your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds such as a click or a heart murmur these sounds may mean a valve isnt working normally the provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist a doctor who specializes in heart diseases the doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam you will also likely need to have one or more heart tests what are the treatments for heart valve diseases most heart valve problems can be treated successfully treatment may include medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well hearthealthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions surgery to repair or replace a valve its possible that you may need surgery even if you dont have symptoms fixing the valve can help can prevent future heart problems there are many ways to do heart valve surgery you and your doctor can decide whats best for you based on your valve problem and general health heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement so when repair is possible its preferred over valve replacement in some cases valve replacement is necessary there are 2 types of replacement valves biologic valves made from pig cow or human tissue these valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years but some may last longer mechanical humanmade valves usually dont wear out but with a mechanical valve you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots and your risk of endocarditis a heart infection is higher than with a biologic valve nih national heart lung and blood institute"

breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs what causes respiratory failure conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure these conditions may affect the muscles nerves bones or tissues that support breathing or they may affect the lungs directly these conditions include diseases that affect the lungs such as copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis pneumonia pulmonary embolism and covid19 conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als muscular dystrophy spinal cord injuries and stroke problems with the spine such as scoliosis a curve in the spine they can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs an injury to the chest can cause this damage drug or alcohol overdose inhalation injuries such as from inhaling smoke from fires or harmful fumes what are the symptoms of respiratory failure the symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood a low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger the feeling that you cant breathe in enough air your skin lips and fingernails may also have a bluish color a high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion some people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness they also may have arrhythmia irregular heartbeat you may have these symptoms if your brain and heart are not getting enough oxygen how is respiratory failure diagnosed your health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on your medical history a physical exam which often includes listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds listening to your heart to check for arrhythmia looking for a bluish color on your skin lips and fingernails diagnostic tests such as pulse oximetry a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood the sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear arterial blood gas test a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood the blood sample is taken from an artery usually in your wrist once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure your provider will look for what is causing it tests for this often include a chest xray if your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure you may have an ekg electrocardiogram this is simple

chronic ongoing how severe it is what is causing it acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency you may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home but if your chronic respiratory failure is severe you might need treatment in a longterm care center one of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body another goal is to treat the cause of the condition treatments may include oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth tracheostomy a surgicallymade hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe a breathing tube also called a tracheostomy or trach tube is placed in the hole to help you breathe ventilator a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs it also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs other breathing treatments such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation nppv which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth to help you breathe in and out fluids often through an intravenous iv to improve blood flow throughout your body they also provide nutrition medicines for discomfort treatments for the cause of the respiratory failure these treatments may include medicines and procedures if you have respiratory failure see your health care provider for ongoing medical care your provider may suggest pulmonary

what are the treatments for asthma in children if your child has asthma you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan the plan will include ways to manage your childs asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks such as strategies to avoid triggers for example if tobacco smoke is a trigger for your child you should not allow anyone to smoke in your home or car shortterm relief medicines also called quickrelief medicines they help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack they include an inhaler to have for your child at all times it may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your childs airways control medicines they work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways not all children will take control medicines whether or not your child needs them depends on how severe the asthma is and how often your child has symptoms if your child has a severe attack and the shortterm relief medicines do not work get medical help right away your childs provider may adjust the treatment until the asthma symptoms are controlled"

attack is different from an sca a heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked during a heart attack the heart usually doesnt suddenly stop beating with an sca the heart stops beating sometimes an sca can happen after or during recovery from a heart attack what causes sudden cardiac arrest sca your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat an sca can happen when the hearts electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias there are different types they may cause the heart to beat too fast too slow or with an irregular rhythm some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body this is the type that causes sca certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to sca they include ventricular fibrillation a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles the hearts lower chambers dont beat normally instead they beat very fast and very irregularly they cant pump blood to the body this causes most scas coronary artery disease cad also called ischemic heart disease cad happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygenrich blood to the heart it is often caused by the buildup of plaque a waxy substance inside the lining of larger coronary arteries the plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart some types of physical stress can cause your hearts electrical system to fail such as intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline this hormone can trigger sca in people who have heart problems very low blood levels of potassium or magnesium these minerals play an important role in your hearts electrical system major blood loss severe lack of oxygen certain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart structural changes in the heart such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease heart infections can also cause changes to the structure of the heart who is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest sca you are at higher risk for sca if you have coronary artery disease cad most

african american especially if you have other conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure heart failure or chronic kidney disease have a personal history of heartbeats that arent regular arrhythmia have a personal or family history of sca or inherited disorders that can cause arrhythmia have a problem with drug or alcohol use have had a heart attack have heart failure what are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest sca usually the first sign of sca is loss of consciousness fainting this happens when the heart stops beating some people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or lightheaded just before they faint and sometimes people have chest pain shortness of breath nausea or vomiting in the hour before they have an sca how is sudden cardiac arrest sca diagnosed sca happens without warning and requires emergency treatment health care providers rarely diagnose sca with medical tests as its happening instead it is usually diagnosed after it happens providers do this by ruling out other causes of a persons sudden collapse if you are at high risk for sca your provider may refer you to a cardiologist a doctor who specializes in heart diseases the cardiologist may ask you to get various heart health tests to see how well you heart is working he or she will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent sca what are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest sca sca is an emergency a person having sca needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away a defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart the electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart thats stopped beating to work well it needs to be done within minutes of the sca most police officers emergency medical technicians and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator call 911 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of sca the sooner you call for help the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin what should i do if i think that someone has had an sca many public places such as schools businesses and airports have automated external defibrillators aeds aeds are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had sca aeds are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia this prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isnt having sca if you see someone who you think has had sca you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr until defibrillation can be done people who are at risk for sca may want to consider having an aed at home ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an aed in your home might help you what are the treatments after surviving sudden cardiac arrest sca if you survive sca youll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment in the hospital your medical team will closely watch your heart they may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another sca they will also try to find out what caused your sca if youre diagnosed with coronary artery disease you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery these procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries often people who have had sca get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd this small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen an icd uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias can sudden cardiac arrest sca be prevented you may be able to lower your risk of sca by following a hearthealthy lifestyle if you have coronary artery disease or another heart disease treating that disease can also lower your risk of sca if you have had an sca getting an implantable cardioverter

help you feel better until other treatments take effect radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism it involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid this slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone it does not affect other body tissues almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism this is because the thyroid hormoneproducing cells have been destroyed but hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer longterm health problems than hyperthyroidism surgery to

also have sudden bleeding inside your body such as in your joints muscles and organs your blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help form clots to stop bleeding people with hemophilia have low levels of one of these factors usually either factor viii 8 or factor ix 9 how severe the hemophilia is depends on the amount of factor in the blood the lower the amount of the factor the more likely it is that bleeding could happen and might lead to serious health problems what are the types of hemophilia there are several different types of hemophilia the most common are hemophilia a classic hemophilia which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor viii 8 hemophilia b christmas disease which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor ix 9 what causes hemophilia most types of hemophilia are inherited they are caused by change in one of the genes also called a mutation that provides instructions for making the clotting factor proteins the change may mean that the clotting proteins dont work properly or that they are missing altogether these genes are on the x chromosome you may have one or two x chromosomes people who are born male have one x chromosome from the mother and one y chromosome from the father they can get hemophilia if their one x chromosome has the gene change people who are born female have two x chromosomes one from the father and one from the mother they usually only get hemophilia if both x chromosomes have the gene change or one x chromosome has the gene change and the other x chromosome is missing or inactive people who are born female who have the gene change on one x chromosome are a carrier of hemophilia sometimes they may have some symptoms of hemophilia they can pass the gene change on to their children hemophilia that is not inherited is called acquired hemophilia it is rare it happens when your body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable a clotting factor this can happen because of pregnancy immune system disorders cancer or allergic reactions to certain medicines sometimes the cause is unknown who is at risk for hemophilia hemophilia is much more common in people who were born male since they can get it with a change to the gene on one x chromosome people who have a family history of hemophilia are also at higher risk what are the symptoms of hemophilia the signs and symptoms of hemophilia are bleeding into the joints this can cause swelling and pain or tightness in the joints it often affects the knees elbows and ankles bleeding into the skin which is bruising bleeding into the muscle and soft tissue which can cause a buildup of blood in the area called a hematoma bleeding of the mouth and gums including bleeding that is hard to stop after you lose a tooth bleeding after circumcision bleeding after having shots such as vaccinations bleeding in the head of an infant after a difficult delivery blood in the urine or stool frequent and hardtostop nosebleeds in some cases severe hemophilia may cause bleeding in the brain this may cause brain damage and can be lifethreatening how is hemophilia diagnosed to find out if you have hemophilia your health care provider will ask about your medical history including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have ask about your family history to find out if you have relatives who have or had hemophilia do a physical exam to look for signs of hemophilia such as bruising do certain blood tests to show if your blood is clotting properly if it does not then you will have clotting factor tests to diagnose the cause of the bleeding disorder these blood tests would show the type of hemophilia and the severity there is genetic testing for the factor viii 8 and factor ix 9 genes this testing may be used in people who have a family history of hemophilia to identify people who are carriers before they make decisions about pregnancy test a fetus for hemophilia during pregnancy test a newborn for hemophilia what are the treatments for hemophilia the best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing clotting factor so that your blood can clot properly this is usually done by injecting replacement clotting factor into a vein the replacement clotting factor may be made from donated human blood or it may be made in a lab this kind is called a recombinant clotting factor replacement clotting factor can help treat a bleeding episode in more severe cases of hemophilia you might get the factor on a regular basis to prevent bleeding you can learn how to inject the factor so that you can do it yourself at home there are other medicines to treat hemophilia they may work by releasing factor viii 8 from where it is stored in the body tissues replacing the function of factor viii 8 or preventing clots from breaking down if bleeding has damaged your joints physical therapy may help them function better good quality medical care from healthcare professionals who know a lot about the disorder can help prevent some serious problems often the best choice for care is to visit a hemophilia treatment center htc centers for disease control and

taking just one type of medicine medical procedures can help improve moderate to severe bph symptoms when medicines dont help enough there are several different types of procedures they all use an instrument inserted into the urethra to either widen the urethra destroy part of the prostate with heat surgery may be helpful when symptoms are severe other treatments havent helped or you have another problem such as bladder damage different types of surgery are used to remove part or all of the prostate make cuts in the prostate to take pressure off the urethra most bph surgery is done

someones life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery what are the types of stroke there are two types of stroke ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain this is the most common type about 80 of strokes are ischemic hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain another condition thats similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack tia its sometimes called a ministroke tias happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time the damage to the brain cells isnt permanent but if you have had a tia you are at a much higher risk of having a stroke who is at risk for a stroke certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke the major risk factors include high blood pressure this is the primary risk factor for a stroke diabetes heart diseases atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke smoking when you smoke you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure a personal or family history of stroke or tia age your risk of stroke increases as you get older race and ethnicity african americans have a higher risk of stroke there are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke such as alcohol and illegal drug use not getting enough physical activity high cholesterol unhealthy diet having obesity what are the symptoms of stroke the symptoms of stroke often happen quickly they include sudden numbness or weakness of the face arm or leg especially on one side of the body sudden confusion trouble speaking or understanding speech sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes sudden difficulty walking dizziness loss of balance or coordination sudden severe headache with no known cause if you think that you or someone else is having a stroke call 911 right away how are strokes diagnosed to make a diagnosis your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history do a physical exam including a check of your mental alertness your coordination and balance any numbness or weakness in your face arms and legs any trouble speaking and seeing clearly run some tests which may include diagnostic imaging of the brain such as a ct scan or mri heart tests which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke possible tests include an electrocardiogram ekg and an echocardiography what are the treatments for stroke treatments for stroke include medicines surgery and rehabilitation which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment the different stages are acute treatment to try to stop a stroke while it is happening poststroke rehabilitation to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke prevention to prevent a first stroke or if you have already had one prevent another stroke acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines you may get tpa tissue plasminogen activator a medicine to dissolve the blood clot you can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started the sooner you can get it the better your chance of recovery if you cannot get that medicine you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger if you have carotid artery disease you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding the first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain the next step is to control it if high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding you may be given blood pressure medicines if an aneurysm if the cause you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization these are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm it also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again if an arteriovenous malformation avm is the cause of a stroke you may need an avm repair an avm is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain an avm repair may be done through surgery injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the avm to block blood flow radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the avm stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage the goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life prevention of another stroke is also important since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one prevention may include hearthealthy lifestyle changes and medicines can strokes be prevented if you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke you can make some hearthealthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke eating a hearthealthy diet aiming for a healthy weight managing stress getting regular physical activity quitting smoking managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels

the cancer may metastasize spread to other parts of the body through the lymph system or the blood breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the united states rarely it can also affect men what are the types of breast cancer there are different types of breast cancer the types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer the types include ductal carcinoma which begins in the cells of the ducts this is the most common type lobular carcinoma which begins in the lobules it is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer inflammatory breast cancer in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast the breast becomes warm red and swollen this is a rare type pagets disease of the breast which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple it usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple it is also rare what causes breast cancer breast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material dna often the

nipple area or the breast pain in any area of the breast how is breast cancer diagnosed your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose breast cancer and figure out which type you have a physical exam including a clinical breast exam cbe this involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the breasts and armpits a medical history imaging tests such as a mammogram an ultrasound or an mri breast biopsy blood chemistry tests which measure different substances in the blood including electrolytes fats proteins glucose sugar and enzymes some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel bmp a comprehensive metabolic panel cmp and an electrolyte panel if these tests show that you have breast cancer you will have tests which study the cancer cells these tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you the tests may include genetic tests for genetic changes such as brca and tp53 her2 test her2 is a protein involved with cell growth it is on the outside of all breast cells if your breast cancer cells have more her2 than normal they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body an estrogen and progesterone receptor test this test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone hormones receptors in cancer tissue if there are more receptors than normal the cancer is called estrogen andor progesterone receptor positive this type of breast cancer may grow more quickly another step is staging the cancer staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body the tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy this biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes what are the treatments for breast cancer treatments for breast cancer include surgery such as a mastectomy which removes the whole breast a lumpectomy to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it but not the breast itself radiation therapy chemotherapy hormone therapy which blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow targeted therapy which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells immunotherapy can breast cancer be prevented you may be able to help prevent breast cancer by making healthy lifestyle changes such as staying at a healthy weight limiting alcohol use getting enough exercisee limiting your exposure to estrogen by breastfeeding your babies if you can limiting hormone therapy if you are at high risk your health care provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk some women at very high risk may decide to get a mastectomy of their healthy breasts to prevent

of asthma is unknown genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma an asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger an asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms different triggers can cause different types of asthma allergic asthma is caused by allergens allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction they can include dust mites mold pets pollen from grass trees and weeds waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens such as breathing in cold air certain medicines household chemicals infections such as colds and the flu outdoor air pollution tobacco smoke occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work exerciseinduced asthma happens during physical exercise especially when the air is dry asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time who is at risk for asthma asthma affects people of all ages but it often starts during childhood certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child being exposed to certain substances at work such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts genetics and family history you are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it especially if its your mother race or ethnicity black and african americans and puerto ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies often having viral respiratory infections as a young child sex in children asthma is more common in boys in teens and adults it is more common in women what are the symptoms of asthma the symptoms of asthma include chest tightness coughing especially at night or early morning shortness of breath wheezing which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out these symptoms can range from mild to severe you may have them every day or only once in a while when you are having an asthma attack your symptoms get much worse the attacks may come on gradually or suddenly sometimes they can be lifethreatening they are more common in people who have severe asthma if you are having asthma attacks you may need a change in your treatment how is asthma diagnosed your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma physical exam medical history lung function tests including spirometry to test how well your lungs work tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures during this test you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways spirometry is done before and after the test peak expiratory flow pef tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort fractional exhaled nitric oxide feno tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out high levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed allergy skin or blood tests if you have a history of allergies these tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system what are the treatments for asthma if you have asthma you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan the plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks it will include strategies to avoid triggers for example if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car shortterm relief medicines also called quickrelief medicines they help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack they include an inhaler to carry with you all the time it may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways control medicines you take them every day to help prevent symptoms they work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways if you have a severe attack and the shortterm relief medicines do not work you will need emergency care your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments if you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty this is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs shrinking the muscle reduces your airways ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily the procedure has some risks so its important to discuss them with your provider"
